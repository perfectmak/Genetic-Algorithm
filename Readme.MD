A Genetic Algorithm Library in c++
==================================

This is a genetic algorithm library that is written in c++.

Note: This library requires a c++11 compiler for it to work.

Getting Started
---------------
A proper documentation is coming up, but in the meantime, you can look in the examples directory for examples on how to use the library.

Todo
----
- Create a custom Makefile. Right now it is build by Netbeans IDE :D
- Encapsulate Selection Algorithm into an Interface
- Allow for multi-threaded running of the algorithm
- Create a shared library from the source code
- (maybe) port the codebase to c++03
