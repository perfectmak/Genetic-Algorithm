A Genetic Algorithm Library in c++
==================================

This is a genetic algorithm library that is written in c++.
It is designed to be easy to extend and flexible to use.

Note: This library requires a c++11 compiler for it to work.

Getting Started
---------------

### Installation
Right now, it is a netbeans project. So you can just drop it in as an existing project in netbeans.
*You are welcome to contribute a Makefile to build a library.

### Usage
A proper documentation is coming up, but in the meantime, you can look in the examples directory for examples on how to use the library.

Todo
----
- Create a custom Makefile to help build a shared library. Right now it is built by Netbeans IDE :D
- Encapsulate Selection Algorithm into an Interface
- Allow for multi-threaded running of the algorithm
- (maybe) port the codebase to c++03

Contributions
-------------
You are welcome to contribute to the software. It is licenced under the GNU GPL V2.
